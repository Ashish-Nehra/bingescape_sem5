As described above, the project aims to provide all the content from all the streaming services and makes them readily available to our customers GLOBALLY, all under a single platform. 

The project aims to greatly reduce the hassle of buying and maintaining several subscriptions, by bundling all the content from different streaming services into one, and thus the customer only needs to buy one subscription to watch it all. 

Especially targeted towards but not limited to the GEN-Z, the project aims to benefit from the limitations of the other streaming services, and during these difficult times when the world is confined to their houses, the entertainment industry only seems to grow exponentially, thus leaving a great scope for growth of our project/service.
